## About this project
This is a simple, portable calculator app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you can use on your keyboard, mouse, or touch screen.
It is a powerful, minimalist calculator that stores your calculation history on your device. Experience it.
This is one of the prototypes for my calculator application.
